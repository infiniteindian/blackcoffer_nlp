people wear fabric gloves? Seeking evidence differential transfer COVID-19 (or coronaviruses generally) surfaces?

evidence fabric bare hands spread covid-19 surface another? (e.g. opening door fabric glove). Assuming fabric doesn’t touch face, bare hands easily do, efforts remember people struggle remember. I’ve thinking prompts prevent face touching, wearing fabric gloves about, don’t promote fabric at-least-no-worse hands transferring virus surfaces. I’m talking community instance people travel food shops, healthcare context. gloves changed settings (e.g. apartment block, bus, shop – switch pair gloves each). gloves ironed hot end day. attempts searching, evidence-based, I’m keen interpreting evidence field sensible. fabric gloves avoid spreading Coronavirus person daily work touching gloves entering house remove glove home clean hand sanitizer kill virus. glove wash sanitizer bowling water 60 70c put home drying night time morning gloves used. time back avoid spreading Coronavirus.
