Big Data Analytics Healthcare

Quality affordable healthcare vision governments globe. high cost Medical service lack sufficient infrastructure detrimental vision. developed countries U.S., reducing healthcare cost agenda point politicians. India, affordable healthcare important “Roti, Kapda Makan” future. Technology play big role reducing healthcare cost making efficient. vast quantity data Hospitals insurance providers.

Sometimes, patients’ fake identity benefit insurance. big data, companies match patients’ information services he/she taken. services patient past medical history patients, analytics tag claim susceptible fraud claims.

Early diagnosis illness major challenge. Patients diagnosis symptom evident. challenging physician treat illness illness grows level. Predictive preventive identify individual develop disease. forms health device iWatch capture data send hospital regular interval time. predictive analysis, hospital predict patient develop illness. Early diagnosis illness doctors treat patients effectively lower cost. Predictive treatment reduce number days patient admitted hospital. inpatient treatment costlier outpatient treatment, doctors discharge patients he/she thinks condition patient serious. hospital monitor patient remotely medical sensors call patient hospital required.

Genetic diseases screened first, second- third-degree relatives reduce morbidity mortality. India, takes 2-3 days average MRI scan. Delay lack medical instruments lack qualified radiologists. problem mitigated integrating Medical imaging big data. Integration medical imaging big data ensure radiologists report short span time. Big data reduce turnaround time required reports reports. Technology convert image graphs charts making easier radiologists read report. data works principle abundance scarcity. So, data have, outcomes obtained. Thus, Big Data technology digital disruptor revolutionize healthcare sector consolidating data disparate platforms build 360-degree view human body healthcare provider generate solutions life-threatening problems improved healthcare opportunities.
