Challenges Opportunities Big Data Healthcare

begin explain big data important lives. Big data simply data, huge size. Data voluminous growing exponentially time. data sets large complex store process traditional data management tools. So, huge data be? Social media sites Facebook generate 500 terabytes data day form photos, video uploads, text messages, etc. single Jet engine generate 10 terabytes data 30 minutes flight time. thousand flights day, generation data reaches petabytes. Data contained sets structured. semi-structured unstructured. size dimension data imagine complicated process analyze it. Therefore, modern methods data analysis developed process information contained big data sets. coming opportunities Big Data provides, limited healthcare. Big data analysis disruptive technology intervened numerous fields proved worth. Healthcare exception. Big data potential change entire dynamics healthcare industry improve quality life people. Healthcare industry large complicated system. involves lot risks demands care. However, large number patients seek emergency care complications cost rise exponentially. India, times, lack sufficient infrastructure support patients, deficit beds doctors provide treatment patients. instance, epidemics break lives lost alarming rate, easily gauge helplessness. However, scenario improving now. advent digitization healthcare system, healthcare providers practitioners access huge amount patient health data. healthcare big data processed analyzed identify patient patterns quickly effectively. information obtained extremely figure chronic health issues provide preventive treatment plans curb disease disorder occurring. method predictive analysis crucial benefits big data healthcare. technology healthcare industry ways infer. Healthcare organizations implemented predictive analysis witnessed reduction ER visits providing support care patients decreasing emergency situations. reduced ER visits timely treatment, benefits big data predictive analysis. Patients high-risk life-threatening issues provided customized treatment facilities. Due lack data, exists lack proper planning hospitals. over-booking staff, lack medical equipment, medicines, facilities result inefficient budgeting ill-management finances. predictive analysis problems solved lead reduced costs efficient management finances. staff allocation admission rate prediction facilitate improvement daily operations healthcare organizations. big data effect recency bias reduced well. give importance recent events tend ignore effect older ones, lead incorrect decisions. recency bias. Big data helps preventing fraudulent activities turn prevents losses insurance companies. changing healthcare industry better, easy reap benefits big data. lot challenges vulnerabilities attached implementation. biggest challenges security. Healthcare big data personal information health history patients. Acts hacking, cyber theft phishing pose threat databases. data stolen sold huge sums money. Protection patientsâ€™ privacy challenge big data implementation. Also, data external data medical information. organization, therefore, care privacy, legal compliances, government policies. Privacy security patients utmost importance breach kind permitted. challenge data classification modeling. size data massive structured heterogeneous. Classifying massive data identify relevant information big challenge. Modeling unstructured data equally difficult. Storage retrieval major challenge. Huge cloud servers sufficient space required store voluminous data. Also, speed high uploading data hassle-free. storage challenge, retrieval matter concern. Integrating data relevant systems link tough job. challenge major opinion. Finding talent expertise implement modern technology arduous task. Shortage required talent crisis market today. hiring talent challenge retain them. Scarce resources data scientists hard find harder retain. easily poached competitors. good efficient compensation strategy, conducive work environment, high incentives, opportunities career growth development ways retaining intellectual talent. nutshell, conclude big data disruptive technology bring landmark healthcare dynamics, challenges vulnerabilities addressed utmost care sense responsibility.
